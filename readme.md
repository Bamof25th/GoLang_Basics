## 1. Introduction to Go
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. It is widely used in building server-side applications, microservices, and tools.

### Why Learn Go?
- Simple and readable syntax
- Built-in concurrency support
- Fast performance
- Strong standard library
- Backed by Google

---

## 2. Setup and Basics

### Install Go
1. Download and install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/).
2. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```
3. Set up your Go workspace with the `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT` environment variables.

### Hello, World!
Write your first Go program:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
Run it with:
```bash
go run main.go
```
